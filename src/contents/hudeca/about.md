#  About RGV


............

RGV will enable you to browse studies related to repro-genomics and to explore transcriptomics data in an interactive way. Datasets from published articles have been gathered and preprocessed so you can actually visualize expression data and use multiple criteria to filter, compare and gain insight into single-cell data. 

### Browse and analyse

RGV was designed to achieve two main goals:
- browsing and viewing information about studies and datasets related to repro-genomics
- exploring, analyzing and comparing cell populations accordint to cell metadata, analyze cell proximity according to the dimensionality reduction method used for the analysis (UMAP, t-SNE, ..) or analyze gene expression


### Data storage
Data are stored according to two different modalities:
