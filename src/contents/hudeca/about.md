#  About


............

The genomics viewer will enable you to browse studies related to human development and to explore transcriptomics data in an interactive way. Datasets from published articles have been gathered and preprocessed so you can actually visualize expression data and use multiple criteria to filter, compare and gain insight into single-cell data. \n  \n 


### Why should I submit my highthroughput data to the  Genomics  Viewer?

Considerable worries have recently been raised regarding the lack of reproducibility of biomedical research. Funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), share this concern and discuss ways to enhance reproducibility by notably providing greater transparency of the data. Journals and public funding agencies have thus begun to make public availability of raw data but also analyzed data a condition of publication or funding, respectively.
In addition, we believe that it is also a matter of give and take, so to speak as making human development data available to the community:

1. it will facilitate data comparison and the development of innovative tools;

2. and, on the other hand, it will make your studies and publications more visible (as investigators will be able to compare their own data with yours) and it will thus boost citations of your scientific articles.
