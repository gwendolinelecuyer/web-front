#  About the viewer 


............

This is the beta version of the Uro-oncogenomics Viewer, which allows scientists to explore single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets in the field of urological cancers. Datasets have been gathered and preprocessed homogeneously  so that users can visualize expression data and use multiple criteria to filter, query and to gain insight into single-cell and spatial data.  

### Browse and analyse

The viewer was designed to achieve two main goals:
- searching, filtering and viewing information about studies and datasets related to Uro-Oncology : when entering the application, end-users are invited to browse a list of studies presented in a data grid that can be filtered and sorted according to a common set of criteria 
- Exploring, analyzing and comparing cell types according to different parameters and visualization modes : the exploration interface is constituted of four main panels that will let you filter the information, view the repartition of cells according to cell metadata, analyze cell proximity according to the dimensionality reduction method used for the analysis (UMAP, t-sne...) or analyze gene expression 


### Data storage

Data are stored according to two different modalities:
- Studies are manually curated and annotated according to a set of pre-defined metadata, so as to enable end-users search and filter the database via a common coherent set of parameters/values
- Each analysis file also integrates its own set of metadata. Files are stored in the LOOM file format, which is based on HDF5, a standard for storing large numerical datasets.


### Submitting data to UncoVer

If you would like to submit a dataset to UncoVer, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:frederic.chalmel@inserm.fr)
