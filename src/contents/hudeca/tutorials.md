#  About


The genomics viewer will enable you to browse studies related to human development and to explore transcriptomics data in an interactive way. Datasets from published articles have been gathered and preprocessed so you can actually visualize expression data and use multiple criteria to filter, compare and gain insight into single-cell data.



## What is HuDeCA ?


HuDeCA is a programmed initiated by Inserm to build a reference atlas about human developmental cells. The project has been designed from the outset to enable contributions to the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), an ambitious international initiative to map all normal cell states of the body at every human life stages.

## Why should I submit my highthroughput data to Hudeca Genomics  Viewer?

Considerable worries have recently been raised regarding the lack of reproducibility of biomedical research. Funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), share this concern and discuss ways to enhance reproducibility by notably providing greater transparency of the data. Journals and public funding agencies have thus begun to make public availability of raw data but also analyzed data a condition of publication or funding, respectively.
In addition, we believe that it is also a matter of give and take, so to speak as making human development data available to the community:

1. it will facilitate data comparison and the development of innovative tools;

2. and, on the other hand, it will make your studies and publications more visible (as investigators will be able to compare their own data with yours) and it will thus boost citations of your scientific articles.


## Future developments and perspectives

In the near future we will extend the scope of the RGV to keep pace with rapid technological, bioinformatics/genomic and biological/clinical advances in the reproductive sciences. In concrete terms, we are currently planning four separate actions:

1. we will gather other relevant data sets from a wide range of species in RGV to cover other reproductive biological topics. In this context, we encourage data submission from colleagues.

2. we will be adding other genetic information related to reproductive disorders (such as GWAS and Quantitative trait loci information from diverse sources and diverse model organisms).

3. we plan to develop community tools that will greatly facilitate collaborative work and stimulate the emergence of novel forms of collaboration in our research field.
